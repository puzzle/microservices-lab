  Starting and using the Lab environment.
---


## Starting the Lab

Open a shell and change your directory to the `docker` folder withing the {{% param "folder_monolith" %}} lab folder.

Start the microservices with
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating network "docker_monolith" with driver "bridge"
Creating monolith-jaeger         ... done
Creating monolith-grafana        ... done
Creating monolith-alertmanager   ... done
Creating monolith-application-db ... done
Creating monolith-prometheus     ... done
Creating monolith-application    ... done
```

Now your environment is up and running.


## Using the Lab


### Available Endpoints

Endpoint                               |  Container   | Purpose
---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------
<http://localhost:8080/shop-orders>    | application  | Return and create new orders
<http://localhost:8080/article-stocks> | application  | List article stock count
<http://localhost:8080/chaos-monkey>   | application  | Lets you add a ChaosMonkey


### Sample Requests

In the folder `requests` within the {{% param "folder_monolith" %}} lab folder there is an IntelliJ IDEA compatible
HTTP Request file named `api.http`. You may run the requests directly from this file or build your own requests.

Get the article stock information
```bash
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/article-stocks
```

Get order information
```bash
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders
```

Create new order
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "articleOrders" : [
        {
            "articleId" : 1,
            "amount" : 1
        }
    ]
}'
```


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Testing scenario

Run the following queries:

* Check the article-stock count
* Create an order for one item of article `1`  
* Check the orders and article-stock again

Answer the questions:

* Is the article-stock count correct?
* What happens if you are running out of stock?


### ChaosMonkey

There is a basic implementation of a ChaosMonkey. It will let you inject errors to methods annotated with `@ChaosMonkey`.
You may configure the ChaosMonkey using the provided RESTful API `/chaos-monkey`.

The following error types are available:

Error Type  |    Executed    | Description
------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------
RateLimit   | Before method  | Rate limit in calls/sec. Default: `Long.MAX_VALUE`
Latency     | After method   | Issues a Thread.sleep() in ms. Default: 0
ErrorRate   | After method   | Lets you specify a percentage of Errors thrown (0 to 1). Default: 0
Exception   | After method   | Always triggers an exception if enabled. Default: `false`

Sample request for configuring the ChaosMonkey which will throw an exception:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/chaos-monkey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {
    "clazzName": "ArticleStockService",
    "methodName": "orderArticles",
    "enabled": true,
    "errorRate": 0.0,
    "latencyMs": 0,
    "permitsPerSec": 9.223372036854776E18,
    "rateLimiterType": "BLOCK",
    "throwException": true
  }
]'
```


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - Injecting an error

Enable a ChaosMonkey for the method `orderArticles` in the `ArticleStockService`.
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/chaos-monkey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {
    "clazzName": "ArticleStockService",
    "methodName": "orderArticles",
    "enabled": true,
    "throwException": true
  }
]'
```
This will throw an `InternalServerErrorException` after execution of the method `orderArticles`.

* Ask yourself what to expect if an exception is thrown?

Issue the request from the Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1.

* What did you observe? Is there any difference?
* Is the data still consistent?
* What's the role of a transaction in this case?


{{% details title="Task Hint" %}}
Since the application throws an `InternalServerErrorException` the order is not created and the stock count remains the
same.

This is due to the fact that the code runs in a single transaction. Throwing a `RuntimeException` from an active
transaction triggers a rollback of the transaction. {{% /details %}}
